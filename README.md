# olympics
A project to put what I learned through Codecademy's Data Science: Analytics course to the test. 

The Data:

The data being analyzed comes from the Event to Athlete level Olympic Games Results from Athens 1896 to Beijing 2022 provided by Joseph Cheng on Kaggle, and was originally sourced from Olympedia.org.

Project Objectives:

For this project, I will be focusing on the athletes and performances in the track and running events at the summer olympics. The primary objective is to address the question: How have the running events in the Olympic Games changed over the span of 120+ years of competition? This will be broken down into smaller questions focused on the performances and builds of each athlete, the distribution of athelets in the different running events, and the representation of countries and athelets in the Games.
